# Bite Search

Search through Bites from [PyBites](https://codechalleng.es/) via Bite number, Learning Path or tag. Can also view all completed Bites or all Bites. 

This is useful for PyBites users who are not in the Premium tier and would like a quick way to access their bites. You will need to download your JSON file under Settings > Data Exports, Progress Reset and Privacy > Your Data, save it in the same location as the python file, and then change the `pybites_json` variable to the file name.
